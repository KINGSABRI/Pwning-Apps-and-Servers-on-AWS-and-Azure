# Requriements for Pentesting AWS Cloud Infra

Amazon lifted the requirement for permission seeking in April 2019 before a pentest. Amazon now allows the following 8 services to be tested without seeking explicit permission.

* Amazon EC2 instances, NAT Gateways, and Elastic Load Balancers
* Amazon RDS
* Amazon CloudFront
* Amazon Aurora
* Amazon API Gateways
* AWS Lambda and Lambda Edge functions
* Amazon Lightsail resources
* Amazon Elastic Beanstalk environments

**Note:** Azure and GCP do not have such requirements. You can read more about Azure and GCP at the below links:

### Limitations

* There are some limitations that need to be kept in mind when testing, especially security tests that could lead to a potential Denial of Service.

Appsecco asked AWS to clarify some of the vagueness in their testing policy and AWS responded to our questions. The exchange can be seen here - https://blog.appsecco.com/aws-changes-its-pentesting-permission-requirement-appsecco-found-out-exactly-what-is-allowed-and-b3603b85de7
